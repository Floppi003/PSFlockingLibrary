# PSFlockingLibrary

PSFlockingLibrary is a customizable Unity3D Flocking-Library used on Rigidbodies. It follows three general rules: 

* Alignment
* Cohesion
* Separation

Each of these rules can be overriden to calculate a custom force that should be added to the boid, providing a lot of flexibility. 


## Features

* Override Alignment, Cohesion or Separation Rule
* Autocreate boids at startup
* Add and Remove Boids at any time
